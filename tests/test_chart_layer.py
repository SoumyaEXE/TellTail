"""
The EvilCharts layer must build a figure on ANY plotly, and on Altair 4 or 5.

    python tests/test_chart_layer.py

Two failure modes are being guarded, and both of them are invisible on a
development machine because a development machine has current libraries:

  1. plotly raises ValueError at figure CONSTRUCTION for a property it does not
     know. `fillgradient`, `barcornerradius` and `griddash` are all newer than
     the plotly Streamlit in Snowflake is likely to solve to, so every one of
     them is capability-probed with a fallback. This exercises each helper with
     the probes forced False — the path that only ever runs in SiS.
  2. Altair renamed selections in 5. Writing the 5 spelling took the Syndromes
     tab down with an AttributeError, because SiS ships Altair 4. This asserts
     the shim resolves against whichever is installed.

Imports the app WITHOUT a Snowflake session, which means everything below the
data-access layer is unreachable. That is fine: this file is about the chart
helpers, which are pure figure construction and depend on nothing but plotly.
