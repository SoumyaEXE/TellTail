"""
Does the synthetic demo signal actually classify as the behaviour it claims?

scripts/demo_spike.py does not write states. It writes 100 Hz accelerometer and
gyroscope SIGNAL and lets the real pipeline classify it — which is what makes
the demo a demonstration rather than a puppet show, and also what makes it
silently breakable. Nudge a threshold in REF.PARAMS and the "scratch" signal
quietly becomes a STAND, MATCH_RECOGNIZE finds nothing, and you discover it
while recording the video on Sunday evening.

So: synthesise each recipe, run the real feature math (mirrored in
tests/epoch_features.py), apply the real state ladder with thresholds parsed out
of warehouse/02_ref_seed.sql, and assert.

Then do the same for whole syndrome signatures, end to end: signal -> features
-> states -> MATCH_RECOGNIZE. If this file is green, `demo_spike.py --syndrome
S1` will produce an S1 match in the warehouse, on the rules-classifier path.
