-- 04_staging_dt.sql   ·   the epoch feature layer
--
-- 10.6 million 100 Hz samples become roughly 106 thousand one-second epochs.
-- This is a hard performance gate, not an optimisation: MATCH_RECOGNIZE over
-- the raw table scans ~10.6M rows per partition and never returns.
--
-- THE feature is neck_back_corr. Two IMUs — collar and back harness — moving in
-- phase means the whole body is translating (walk, trot, gallop). Two IMUs
-- decoupled means the neck is moving and the body is not, which is exactly the
-- shake/scratch family the aural syndrome depends on. One CORR() across two
-- sensor streams gives a physically interpretable discriminator, and it exists
-- only because this dataset has two sensors.
--
-- REFRESH_MODE is FULL and declared. The sample-level window functions (epoch
-- mean for zero-crossing rate, LAG for jerk) are not incrementally refreshable.
-- Setting INCREMENTAL explicitly fails compilation with an unsupported
-- construct; AUTO silently resolves to FULL. Declaring it makes the cost
-- visible instead of surprising.
