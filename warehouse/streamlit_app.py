TELLTAIL — Streamlit in Snowflake.

Nine tabs, in narrative order. A judge who clicks left to right gets the argument
without reading a word of the post:

  1 Pack            who
  2 Live Collar     is it real
  3 Ethogram        what normal looks like
  4 Syndromes       THE FINDING
  5 Baselines       why it is abnormal for THIS dog
  6 Vet Note        what to do
  7 Drivers         what explains it
  8 Shelter Reality why it matters
  9 Pipeline        how it was built

Plus two more: On Chain, the published attestations with a link out to Solana
Explorer for every one of them, and Ask TELLTAIL, Cortex answering only from
rows.

SIX SiS-ONLY HAZARDS, ALL HANDLED HERE. Every one of them reproduces nowhere
else, which is what makes them expensive:

  1. Snowpark to_pandas() returns numerics as object-dtype Decimal. Plotly then
     treats them as CATEGORIES, so y becomes the row index and every line chart
     renders as an identical straight diagonal. `rows()` converts element-wise
     with float() and every chart is fed plain Python lists.
  2. SiS pins an older Streamlit than you develop against. st.column_config is
     guarded with hasattr and there is an HTML table fallback.
  3. plotly is not importable without environment.yml shipped to the stage next
     to this file. deploy_streamlit.py refuses to deploy without it.
  4. Old plotly drops traces whose customdata is a mixed-type numpy array, and
     the axes scale while zero points render. Hover strings are prebuilt and
     passed as text= with hoverinfo="text".
  5. There is no outbound network, so a photograph can only be shown if its
     bytes are already in the account. Breed photos are base64 in
     REF.BREED_IMAGE, written by scripts/fetch_breed_images.py; everything
     else on screen is inline SVG. They are photographs OF THE BREED and the
     page says so everywhere one appears.
  6. Custom bidirectional components cannot be installed — there is no way to
     serve a component's frontend bundle from the sandbox. The chat on the
     last page is AI-Yash/st-chat's design ported to plain HTML and CSS, with
     locally drawn avatars in place of its DiceBear URLs.

AND ONE ARCHITECTURAL RULE: this app reads TABLES. It never calls a Cortex AI
function, because a render path that costs credits is a render path that will
exhaust a trial cap during a demo. Every note, triage and brief on screen was
batched into a table by a task.

     CHAT BUBBLES — ported from AI-Yash/st-chat (streamlit_chat/frontend/

     avatar, and a .msg::after triangle made of transparent borders.

     PORTED RATHER THAN INSTALLED, for two reasons that are both hard rules
     here. Streamlit in Snowflake cannot load a custom bidirectional
     component — there is no way to serve the package's compiled frontend
     bundle from inside the sandbox. And st-chat draws its avatars from
     DiceBear over HTTPS, which is exactly the outbound request SiS blocks,
     so the stock component would render two broken images per turn. The
     avatars below are inline SVG for the same reason the breed photos are
     base64.

     One deliberate change: st-chat anchors the tail to the row at top:0
     with border-top-color, which works because every message is its own
     iframe. In one page that puts a stray notch above each bubble, so the
     tail is anchored to the bubble and points sideways.

# The stand-in dog, for the study breeds Stanford Dogs does not carry.

# Beauceron, Hovawart, Mudi and the crossbreeds have no reference photograph in
# REF.BREED_IMAGE, and the honest thing to show in their place is a picture
# that is obviously a drawing rather than a photograph of anything.

# Font Awesome's "dog" icon, via svgrepo.com/show/351961 (CC BY 4.0). ONE PATH,
# 406 characters. It replaced a 58 KB auto-traced photograph of a Labrador that
# had to be colour-inverted at render time because its first path was the whole
# canvas with the dog cut out of it — 148 paths of trace noise to say
# "placeholder". This says it at 1/140th the size and reads better at 44 px,
# which is the only size it is ever drawn at.
#
# Still served as ONE CSS background-image rather than inline copies: the pack
# grid draws 45 of these, and a background is rasterised once and blitted.

# A REAL DOG SKELETON, because the sensor diagram is the one picture on this
# dashboard that makes an anatomical claim.
#
# What was here before was four line segments and a circle for a head. It could
# not show what the tab is actually arguing: that the collar sits on the
# CERVICAL vertebrae and the harness on the THORACIC vertebrae, and that those
# two points move independently when the head acts alone.

# Source: "Skeleton of a dog labelled" by A.Spielhoff, Wikimedia Commons,

# condition, not decoration. Derived by stripping the German labels, the
# dotted leader rules and the callout arrows, then rounding all coordinates to
# one decimal. Original viewBox 1400x630 is preserved so the marker
# coordinates below stay meaningful.
#
# The two marker positions were read off a coordinate grid rendered over the
# artwork, not guessed: (497, 237) is mid-cervical, (712, 240) is mid-thoracic.

# ===========================================================================
# THREE RENDERERS, BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD AT THREE DIFFERENT THINGS
#
# plotly  — 3D, and only 3D. It is the one of the three that can put a point
#           cloud, a hull or a surface in a rotatable scene. Neither of the
#           others can: Vega-Lite is a 2D grammar by specification and Bokeh's
#           core has no 3D glyph (its `surface3d` demo is a custom extension
#           that loads vis.js from a CDN, and SiS has no outbound network, so
#           it is not an option here rather than merely a bad one).
# altair   — LINKED SELECTION. Drag a box on one chart and the others filter,
#            with no rerun, no callback and no round trip to the warehouse,
#            because the whole interaction compiles into the Vega spec and runs
#            in the browser. Streamlit cannot do that with plotly at all.
# bokeh    — LINKED AXES over a long signal. Shared x_range across stacked
#            panels plus a RangeTool scrubber is Bokeh's one genuinely
#            unmatched trick, and a 100 Hz waveform is exactly its use case.
#
# A chart goes to whichever of the three owns the job. Nothing is ported for
# the sake of using a library.

        # THREE LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION, ON ONE X AXIS YOU CAN DRAG.
        #
        # These were three separate plotly figures stacked down the page: the
        # 100 Hz waveform, the per-second features derived from it, and the
        # correlation the states are built on. Reading them together is the
        # entire point of the tab — you are meant to see a burst in panel 1
        # become a spike in panel 2 and a collapse toward zero in panel 3, at
        # the same instant. Three independent figures cannot do that. Zoom
        # into six interesting seconds on one and the other two still show
        # sixty, so the reader has to align them by eye and take it on trust.
        #
        # WHY BOKEH AND NOT THE OTHER TWO. Sharing `x_range` between figures
        # makes the pan, the zoom and the range scrubber below drive all three
        # at once, and the linked crosshair puts one vertical line through the
        # same instant in every panel. That is a Bokeh model-level feature —
        # plotly has no cross-figure range binding without a Dash callback,
        # and Streamlit gives plotly no callbacks; Vega-Lite can bind scales
        # across a concat but not to a scrubber over a 30 000-point signal.
        #
        # THE X AXIS IS SECONDS, NOT WALL CLOCK, and deliberately: a
        # TIMESTAMP_NTZ comes back naive, so rendering it as a datetime axis
        # would silently label it in the viewer's timezone. Elapsed seconds
        # from the first sample also lets the 100 Hz panel and the 1 Hz panels
        # share one exact numeric axis with no resampling.

        #
        # Panel 1 shows amplitude over time and the cube above shows the shape
        # of the motion, but neither shows FREQUENCY, which is the thing that
        # actually separates the behaviours this app is about. A trot is a
        # narrow ridge at the stride rate, around 2 Hz. A head shake is a much
        # higher, much broader hump at 5-9 Hz. A resting dog is flat. In the
        # 100 Hz trace both look like "vigorous motion" — which is exactly the
        # confusion the two-sensor correlation was introduced to resolve, and
        # this is the same confusion viewed from the other side.
        #
        # A SURFACE RATHER THAN A HEATMAP, on purpose and not for decoration.
        # The interesting structure here is a RIDGE — a peak that holds a
        # frequency for a few seconds and then moves — and a ridge is a shape,
        # so height reads it faster than colour does. The colour is carried
        # too, so nothing depends on judging a height by eye.
        #
        # SHORT-TIME FOURIER, WRITTEN OUT. 256 samples is 2.56 s per column at
        # 100 Hz, which is long enough to resolve a 2 Hz stride (about five
        # cycles) and short enough that a head shake is not smeared across the
        # whole window. Hann window, or every column carries the spectral
        # leakage of its own rectangular edges and the whole surface sits on a
        # false noise floor.

        #
        # Every other figure in this app answers exactly the question its author
        # had. This one lets the reader ask their own: drag a box around the
        # long-and-confident findings and the three panels beside it re-count
        # themselves to describe only those — which syndromes they were, how
        # severe, which body system, which dogs. Click a syndrome bar and the
        # scatter reduces to that code. Nothing round-trips to Snowflake and
        # nothing reruns the script; the selection, the filter and the
        # re-aggregation are all compiled into the Vega spec and executed by
        # the browser on data that is already there.
        #
        # WHY ALTAIR AND NOT THE OTHER TWO. This is the one thing Vega-Lite has
        # that neither of the others does under Streamlit. A plotly selection
        # event cannot filter a second plotly figure without a callback, and
        # Streamlit has no callback to give it — the closest available is a
        # st.plotly_chart selection that reruns the whole page and re-queries
        # the warehouse to redraw four charts. Bokeh could do it with CustomJS,
        # which means writing the cross-filter by hand in JavaScript. Here it
        # is four `transform_filter`s.
        #
        # ONLY THE COLUMNS THE CHART USES ARE PASSED. `finds` carries
        # evidence, pattern_text, define_text and why_not_threshold — four long
        # strings per row that the table below needs and this does not. Vega
        # inlines its data into the spec as JSON, so handing it the whole row
        # would ship roughly a megabyte of SQL prose to the browser to draw
        # 500 dots.

what makes the behavioural tail pointed rather than routine.

<b>Why any of this is on a chain at all.</b><br>
A shelter taking in a dog has no way to check what a previous owner's app
claims about it, and no reason to trust a vendor's database that the vendor can
edit. An attestation is a claim with a timestamp that its author cannot quietly
revise: <b>{fmt(len(done), 0)}</b> findings are now published on Solana
{cluster}, each one signed by the wallet above and readable by anyone with the
link — no account, no API key, no permission from us.
<br><br>
<span class="tt-quiet">Devnet, not mainnet: this is a demonstration of the
mechanism, and devnet SOL has no value. Nothing about the architecture changes
on mainnet except the cluster and the cost. TELLTAIL is not a diagnostic device
and an attestation is a record of what the pipeline found, not a
diagnosis.</span>
